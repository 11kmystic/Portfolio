<h1 align="left">Hi there!👋 Welcome to my GitHub!</h1>

###

<p align="left">My name is Kevin and I'm a Masters of Analytics Student at Georgia Tech doing the Computaional Track! Currently, I'm located in Vancouver BC</p>

###

<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>

<p align="left">My core skills include Python programming, data science, and natural language processing. I have diverse experience across fields such as opera, biotechnology, and business development. I've even had some stints in quantum computing ☺️. One of my favorite projects involved dissecting data on electric vehicles—a topic that resonates with me both professionally and personally, as I plan to purchase one myself someday.</p>

<p align="left">I pride myself on being able to speak to interdisciplanry teams and being able to look at the same problem from multiple angles. I also consider myself deeply humanitarian, and wish to use both my technical skills and doundless compassion to usher in a responsible new age of tech.</p>

<p align="left">📚 I'm currently learning: Qiskit, SpaCy, and  Cantonese.<br>🎯 Goals: Bring a touch of humanity, creativity, and reverance for all that is to tech.<br>🎲 Fun fact: I'm a tenor and high countertenor! The latter being of of the rarest voice types. I also love hip-hop dance.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">I code with Python, R, SQL!</h2>
